# Customer-Segmentation using K Means Clustering
Customer segmentation is an Unsupervised Machine Learning problem. In such a method, we deals with unlabelled data. For this project, I collected Customer dataset of a famous mall from Kaggle. I explored the data with pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn, choosed optimum number of clusters using WCSS, clustered the data using K Means Clustering Model and visualize the clusters.
